# FactsWithAbi
A collection of highly relevant facts with Abi

## How to make a highly relevant fact generator of your own!
1. Install requirements.txt
2. Create your embeddings database
3. Create the frontend
4. Create an embedding for a given prompt
5. Find the closest furthest, or medium embedding in the database
6. Return the actual text from the document indicating whether it is just like, a little like, or not at all like the original prompt.

Forray into pinecone, limits don't work for me.

Found out that most vector dbs/libraries are set up to find the closest things, not the farthest things. Did some research and found info on farthest neighbors
